Hamming (72,64) code SECDED FEC software implementation

Based on implementation in liquid-dsp by Joseph Gaeddert
https://github.com/jgaeddert/liquid-dsp/blob/master/src/fec/src/fec_secded7264.c

Adapted by me (Sultan Qasim Khan) to be standalone and with somewhat
different usage semantics (return size of encoded/decoded data, and
optionally report number of errors in decoding).

The implementation is MIT licensed just as the original.
