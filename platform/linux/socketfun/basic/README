socketfun - basic
-----------------

This accomplishes a rudimentary server and clients that can communicate with the server.
The client is prompted to enter a username.
If "arjun024" is entered as username the server replies "Authentication successful",
else it replies "Authentication failed".
Error checking is not performed for purpose of brevity and readability.
